<h2 align="left">IMPORTANCE??</h2>
<p align="left"><font color="black"  face="calibri">Education is very important tool for the people all over the world to make balance of life and its existence on the earth. It is the tool which stimulates everyone to go ahead and succeed in life as well as provides ability to overcome challenges in life. It is the one and only way to acquire knowledge and improve our skills in any particular field according to the need. It makes us able to create fine balance of our body, mind and spirit.

It trains us whole life and brings lots of opportunities to our way to get better prospects required for the career growth. Each and every individual need proper education to enhance their own life standards as well as become a part of the social and economic growth of their own country. Future of the any person or country depends on the education system strategy followed. Even after lots of awareness programmes about proper education in our country, there are many villages still left which are not having proper resources and awareness for education of people living there.

Though condition has improved than earlier and various steps have been taken by the government to improve the education status in the country. Well being of the society depends on the well being of the people living in that society. It brings economic and social prosperity all through the country by solving issues and identifying solutions.<br>Education plays a great role in everyone’s life by building personality, improving knowledge and skill and providing feeling of well being of a person. Education has been divided into three categories in our country as Primary education, Secondary education and Higher Secondary education. It develops our analytical skills, character and overall personality. Education helps a person in nourishing his present and future by ensuring aim of the life. Quality and importance of the education is increasing day by day.

Every child must to go school in his/her appropriate age as everyone has equal rights for the education from birth. The growth and development of any country depends on the quality of education system set for young ones in the schools and colleges. However, the education system in every areas of the country is not same so the proper growth and development of the people and society varies according to the weak and strong education system of the particular region.The term “education” originated from Latin word “educate” which means to “bring up.” The use of the term “education” should, therefore, not be limited to the process of imparting knowledge to pupils in some specific subjects. It is a wholesome process of developing a child by training them in habits and attitudes that nurture them to success and ability to face the future life with confidence. According to Plato, education is a process that is meant to develop all the beauty and perfection that a child is capable of, both in the body and soul. In short, Plato implied that it is a process of developing both a sound mind and a sound body. Education aims at developing all the faculties of man, especially the mind, so as to appreciate the contemplation of supreme goodness, truth, and beauty, which contribute to perfect happiness.

Education is very important because it is an avenue that facilitates the process of cultural transmission. All societies credit their existence to culture. Education allows the culture of a society to be transmitted to young people, hence, the continuation of society. Every new generation has to be educated in the ways of the group so as to promote the existence of the traditions. Education fulfills the needs of each society, as every society has its specific ways of doing things. A good example is the African communities, as  much of their culture has not been influenced by the modern education. The communities have an initiation stage at adolescence that is meant to graduate people to adulthood. During this period, the initiates are taught all the ways and secrets of the community. The initiates are then considered to be full members of that particular society in which they have been initiated.

Education is a process that promotes socialization. A large part of a person’s social skills are acquired through the process of education. Socialization is an important aspect of human life, hence, has to be promoted positively to be beneficial to the society. Most governments have invested in education because they realize the importance of socialization. Education forms a continuous process in which definite ways of perception, acting, and feeling are imposed into a child for them to fit it into the society. The process of education allows young people to develop socialization skills that they cannot acquire spontaneously. It facilitates the transmission of the norms of a group so that persons can conduct themselves in approved ways. They are able to know things that are wrong and right.

Education allows people to fit in different stages of life. Social learning is a continuous process that starts at birth and ends at death. No human being can achieve total perfection in it. There is no point in time that individuals can consider themselves to have acquired everything about a society or group, and that there remains nothing to be studied. Human beings belong to different groups at different stages of their lives. While in these groups, they have to learn new rules and patterns to govern their behavior. People do not play the same roles throughout their lives. Education helps them fit in the different roles that they are faced with in life. Human life begins with childhood; they get into adolescence then adulthood, marry, sire children, get into middle life, retire, and then eventually become old and die. The different roles come with different patterns of behavior, which have to be learnt. This implies that throughout the life of a human being, people are involved in the education process. It helps in developing skills that are important for different stages of life.

Education is important because it helps individuals to acquire knowledge. Acquisition of knowledge is also a continuous process. Knowledge comprises a large sphere of concepts that are boundless and limitless. No one can master all the concepts or exhaust them. The world is a miraculous entity that is comprised of a lot of things. The more one tries to know about something, the more it becomes mysterious. Human entities, therefore, strive to acquire as much knowledge as possible about the universe; although, this is a limited process that is hampered with complexities. Education facilitates the continuous endeavor to acquire knowledge.

Education creates employment. The field of education has created many job opportunities in the world. Governments budget huge sums of money to be used in the education sector in doing research and employing teachers. The research process has opened different opportunities that previously did not exist. The industries and inventions that are in the world are the outcomes of education. The industries provide a lot of employment opportunities to people. The education sector has also employed millions of people to work as teachers, lecturers, and researchers among others. Education provides a source of income to those who are employed in the education sector and the students who are being taught. Education empowers young people with knowledge that is essential for various fields. After one’s completion of the college, they are able to get jobs in different institutions, hence, earn a living.

Education forms the basis of a good life. Human beings get to understand themselves through the process of education. One gets to understand themselves fully as a human being through the process of education. The training of the human mind helps them to see things differently compared to other creatures. One is, therefore, transformed from primarily being an animal to being a human. The process of education empowers human beings to be superior to other beings, and make the most out of their environment to live a good life. Living a good life does not only imply having the material needs, but also understanding the significance of life. A man who lives a good life understands what they live for and the things that they need to struggle to get. Education allows man to live an integrated life, that is, a life with significance.</font></p>
